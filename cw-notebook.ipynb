    "After talking to our lab tutor for guidance on what dataset/datasets to finalize, we decided to use brain stroke and scenery classification datasets for the coursework.  \n",
    "We will use brain stroke dataset for most of the coursework and switch to scenery classification for the part of the coursework where we use CNN."
